# Data

Update: April 2025 - The specific version of DBpedia knowledge graph (DBpedia 2016-10), test datasets and relational similarity matrix used in the paper, which were previously accessible at [this location](http://carl.cs.indiana.edu/data/fact-checking/data.zip), aren't unfortunately available anymore. However, the following instructions might be helpful if you are interested in running the code.

## Knowledge Graph

You may use [this example script](https://github.com/shiralkarprashant/knowledgestream/blob/master/create_knowledge_graph_04292025.py) to re-create a knowledge graph from one of the latest versions of the [raw DBpedia datasets](https://databus.dbpedia.org/dbpedia/collections/latest-core). An old video demonstrating how to use the code is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xlhyna1oiqtn86j/knowledge-stream-linux-demo-09032019.mov?dl=0). Once assembled, place the data inside the `knowledgestream` directory. Processing the raw dataset should lead to creation of three files collectively representing the knowledge graph: nodes.txt, relations.txt, abbrev_cup_dbpedia_filtered.nt. You may also try using the following script to generate the required graph files (.npy): [KG generation script](https://github.com/shiralkarprashant/knowledgestream/blob/master/datastructures/test_graph.py)

## Test Datasets

The following Wikipedia lists contain the true triples (relationships) between entities used in the test datasets in the paper. The false triples (negative examples) were created by "perturbing" the set of objects in each list by making a "local-closed world assumption (LCWA)."

- NBA-Team: [List of NBA players who have spent their entire career with one franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_players_who_have_spent_their_entire_career_with_one_franchise)
- Oscars: [Academy Award for Best Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture)
- FLOTUS: [List of First Ladies of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_First_Ladies_of_the_United_States)
- World Capitals: [List of national capitals in alphabetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals_in_alphabetical_order)
- Birthplace-Deathplace: This was created just based on DBpedia. Persons having different birth and death place were identified and 250 individuals were sampled from five buckets partitioning [Birthplace-Deathplace](http://carl.cs.indiana.edu/data/fact-checking/histogram_persons_vs_facts.pdf) distribution. Their death place was forged as a false example (or triple) of their birth place, while their birth place was taken as a true triple, thereby creating 250 true and 250 false triples. 

## Relational Similarity Matrix

The relational similarity matrix derived using TF-IDF representations of relations of a graph can be created by following Section II.A of the paper. 

# System requirements

* **OS:** Linux Ubuntu / Mac OSX 10.12 (Sierra)
* **Python:** Python 2.7 (we developed and tested using the Anaconda distribution)
* **Memory requirements:** >4 GB

# Install

```python setup.py build_ext -if```

```python setup.py install```

Note: for the second command, please do sudo in case you need installation rights on the machine.


# Run 

**Note**: For the ouput directory parameter ("-o") for any of the algorithms in this repository, please make sure the directory exists before launching the process. Otherwise, it throws an AssertionError due to a non-existent directory.
